I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu), advised by [Prof. Arindam Banerjee](https://arindam.cs.illinois.edu/). I also closely work with [Aadirupa Saha](https://aadirupa.github.io/). In the past I obtained a Master's degree from the [Department of Computer Science and Automation](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), working with [Shalabh Bhatnagar](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~shalabh/) and [Gugan Thoppe](https://sites.google.com/site/gugancth/).

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning with an emphasis on Sequential decision making under uncertainty. I am currently interested in the following research threads:

- Neural Contextual Bandits
- Online Learning under resource constraints
- Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Learning: Optimization, Generalization, and Geometry
