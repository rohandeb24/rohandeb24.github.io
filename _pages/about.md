I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu), advised by [Prof. Arindam Banerjee](https://arindam.cs.illinois.edu/). I am broadly interested in Machine Learning with an emphasis on Sequential decision making under uncertainity. Currently I am interested in the following research threads:
- Reinforcement Learning
- Neural Contextual Contextual Bandits
- Online Learning under resource constraints
- Deep Learning: Optimization, Generalization, and Geometry
